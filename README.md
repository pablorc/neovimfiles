# neovimfiles

My [neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration

## What does it contain?

Check out init.vim file to see all the plugins. The list keeps slowly growing while I use and detect my needs. 

I mostly work with frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), Ruby and Rails.

*Note*: If you want a full powered neovim with lots of features this is not your best shot. 
I used to fork my vimfiles fron other people, but having tons of plugins doesn't made me more productive. 
I was loading a huge editor but I didn't managed to use all plugins (you know, learning all commands is slow). 
It's better start from scratch and add plugins when they are needed, but it's up to you!
