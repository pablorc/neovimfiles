## Acknowledgements

I want to say thanks to [@theprimeagen](https://github.com/theprimeagen) and [@tjdevries](https://github.com/tjdevries) for encouraging me to update this codebase with their great videos. I finally updated my innecessarily old vim files that worked for years but they were a PITA ðŸ˜…. Thanks to that, the UX and my toolkit have improved x1000 and I feel I want to tweak more often my config.

Long life for you guys, Lua and [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)!
